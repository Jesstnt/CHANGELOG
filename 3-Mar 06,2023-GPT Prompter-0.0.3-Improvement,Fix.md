# Added Token Usage Logs
We've introduced a logging system to keep track of token usage, providing you with a clearer overview of your bot's activity.

# Restricted Token Usage
Now, token usage is restricted based on specified plans per month. This ensures fair usage and helps maintain a smooth experience for all users.

# Exceeded Token Threshold Message
In case users exceed their allocated token limit, a helpful message will now notify them. This serves as a friendly reminder to consider upgrading their plan or manage usage more efficiently.
